# Interactive Cartoon Figure -2020
> ⚠️ Note: This is a very old creative coding project built with p5.js during the early stages of learning JavaScript and graphics programming.

This project draws an interactive cartoon-style figure whose head follows your mouse horizontally.
When you click, the figure’s neck shortens and body height changes, creating a fun animated effect.
